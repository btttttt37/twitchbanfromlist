## AHK text entry script that bans people from a text file.

Very hacked together but "simple" way of using AHK to ban a bunch of identified bot accounts, 
You can even run it before stream to make sure that you have the latest ban list (if you trust the list below)

## Instructions:
	1. Go to the releases page, downloaded the latest exe
	2. Run the exe.
	3. Go to your twitch chat click in the text entry field
	4. Push F12
	5. DO NOT TOUCH YOUR MOUSE OR KEYBOARD WHILE THE SCRIPT RUNS 
	6. Watch as all of the names on the list get banned one after the other in your chat box!
	7. A box will pop up at the end when the script completes!

If latest release is after last updated date/time then it should have the latest, otherwise, notify me, and/or just submit a PR
